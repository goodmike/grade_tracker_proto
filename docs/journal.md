## Trying out backbone.js

* First, do things the easy way, with JSON.
* Set up a /grades url (/grades.json?) for a backbone client to fetch from.
* Following examples in Hypermedia book, set up tempates for the server view.

* I could make an alternate template that puts data on page to bootstrap it.
